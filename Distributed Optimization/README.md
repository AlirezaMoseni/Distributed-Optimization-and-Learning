### **Project 2: Weighted Average Algorithm for Distributed Learning**

This project tackles training deep learning models in a decentralized way, eliminating the need for a central server. It achieves this by employing a distributed optimization algorithm based on weighted averages. The project investigates how the algorithm's performance is affected by the way users communicate with each other, represented by different communication graph structures. The project focused on analyzing how well this algorithm converges under various communication graph structures.
