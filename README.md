## Distributed Optimization and Learning Course Projects (Tehran University)

This repository contains the projects I completed for the Distributed Optimization and Learning course at Tehran University.

**Getting Started**

- This repository assumes you have Python and libraries for Deep Learning, such as Pytorch.

**Contents**

This repository includes folders for each project.  Each folder will likely contain:

- Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts implementing the project.
- Data files used for training and testing (if applicable).
- README.md file (optional, for project-specific details).

**Project Descriptions**

**1. Decentralized Optimization: Primal and Dual Decomposition in Federated Setting**

This project explored decentralized optimization algorithms for training a deep learning model in federated settings. 

**2. Distributed Optimization: Weighted Average Algorithm** 

This project focused on distributed optimization algorithms for training deep learning models across multiple machines without a coordinator server.
