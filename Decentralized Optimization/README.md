### **Project 1: Primal and Dual Decomposition Algorithms in Federated Settings**

In this project we explored the use of decentralized optimization in for Federated settings. Instead of bringing all the data to one location for training, this approach allows training models without a central server, which can improve data privacy and security. Three specific algorithms, FedAVG, FedProx, and FedADMM, were implemented and tested. These algorithms take different approaches to solving the optimization problem, with FedAVG and FedProx using a primal decomposition strategy and FedADMM employing a dual decomposition strategy. We evaluated their performance on a benchmark image classification task using the Mnist dataset. This will allow us to compare the effectiveness of these algorithms in a federated learning setting.
